# Charles N Wyble Candidate Information Sheet

## Introduction

Hello,

I apologize for the form letter response.

I receive a high volume of recruiter emails every day and I've found this letter to be the most efficient way to
handle the high volume of emails and reduce back and forth emails/texts/calls.

If you have any questions/comments/concerns not covered by this document, please let me know via e-mail and I'm happy to address them!

If you ask me something answered in this document, I will not respond and will not move forward with the opportunity, so please read it in detail!

## Re: share my ID over email

I WILL NOT share my (full or redacted) photo ID over email or any other electronic written  
communication. If that is "required" then I have no interest in moving forward with this opportunity.

I am happy to get on a teams/zoom/google meet etc call and show my ID.

## Re: professional references

I am happy to provide professional references once an interview with the end client/customer/hiring manager/team has been scheduled. I will NOT provide references up front. If that is "required" then I have no interest in moving forward with this opportunity.

## Re: relocation/travel

| Question                       | Answer |
| ------------------------------ | ------ |
| Am I open to relocation?       | No     |
| Am I open to up to 100% travel | Yes    |

Please be aware that:

- I am happy to come onsite (at client expense (paid up front)) for training/orientation/fingerprinting etc.

## Rate Schedule (compensation expectations)

I have a **very strong** preference for fully remote roles. I would prefer fulltime roles, but am open to contract roles.

I am open to on-site roles, but they must pay at least **$160,000.00** per yer, be fulltime and be located in the greater Austin Texas area.

### Rate

I have some room to be flexible on salary, but I would expect to be paid the pevailing market rate. Depending on the job, as of Q1 2025, the market rate is from **$120,000** to **$180,000** or higher for system admin/engineering roles.

### Compensation type

In regards to compensation type, I am open to:

- w2
- corp to corp (I have my own LLC)
- 1099  

If you have rate options for any of the compensation types above, please send them all. I will pick which one works best for my situation and the opportunity.

If it's a different rate with/without benefits, send both.

If the above is in alignment with this opportunity, please feel free to send me an RTR with the best rate you can offer.
